Football Stats
By: Lucas Olmeta

Purpose: 

This is a full-stack personal project being made by Lucas Olmeta. It's purpose is to search for, filter, and display professional football / soccer players' basic information and statistics. Although it is still in development, this project is functional and can now be viewed live at footballthroughstats.netlify.app. 

Structure: 

This GitHub includes a Python backend, which searches, filters, visualizes, and formats data before passing it to the frontend. The backend employs Flask, and is hosted on Heroku. The backend code can be viewed within the 'api' directory in the GitHub's root directory. 
    
Additionally, this GitHub includes a frontend, which is tasked with displaying this data in a neat way. The frontend consists of pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; no framework was used on the frontend. Netlify is used to host the webpage. The frontend code can be viewed within the 'front-end' directory in the GitHub's root directory.
