Football Stats
    By: Lucas Olmeta

Purpose: 
    This is a full-stack personal project being made by Lucas Olmeta. It's purpose is to search for, filter, and display both basic personal information and statistics for professional football / soccer players. Although it is still in development, this project is functional and can now be viewed live at footballthroughstats.netlify.app. 

Structure: 
    This GitHub includes a Python backend, which searches for requested data, with aditional functionality to filter, visualize, and format the data before passing it to the frontend. The backend employs Flask, and is hosted on Heroku. The backend code can be viewed within the 'api' directory in the GitHub's root directory. 
    
    The frontend, which is tasked with displaying this data in a neat way, consists of pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No framework was used on the frontend, and Netlify is used to host the webpage. The frontend code can be viewed within the 'front-end' directory in the GitHub's root directory.
